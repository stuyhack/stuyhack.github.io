				<blockquote>
					<p>
						We hold these Shells to be self-evident, that not all C derivatives were created equal, that they are endowed by their compilers with certain inalienable instructions, that among these are stacks, -Wall, and the pursuit of -O3. That to ensure functional code, loopholes will be instituted by their programmers, giving their power to the exploiter. That whenever a loophole is patched, another shall arise to be discovered in the future. To prove this, let realizations be set unto the unenlightened world:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>No framework is without sin.</li>
						<li>No program is without bugs.</li>
						<li>No code can be without vulnerability.</li>
						<li>No information connected to a network can be 100% protected.</li>
						<li>Nothing is truly secure.</li>
						<li>Big Brother is watching you...</li>
